### ðŸ“„ Description
<div align="justify">

This project presents a comprehensive **dashboard analysis of Airbnb listings in New York City from 2009 to 2020** using Tableau. The dashboard is divided into two main pages: *Listing* and *Host*. The Listing page analyzes spatial and categorical distributions of listings, including room types, pricing by district, average review scores, and temporal patterns of guest activity. Key insights include the dominance of Brooklyn and Manhattan in listing volume, the higher pricing in Manhattan, and seasonal spikes in reviews during August to October. The Host page focuses on host behavior and quality metrics such as verification status, superhost proportion, hosting growth over the years, and response metrics. The analysis reveals that most hosts own only one listing and that superhosts generally respond faster and have higher acceptance rates. Predictive insights indicate a drastic drop in new hosts in 2020 due to COVID-19. Actionable recommendations are included, targeting marketing, quality control, promotion strategy, and host recruitment to strengthen Airbnbâ€™s operational presence in NYC.
